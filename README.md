# intensity_averaging

The bin directory contains the script used to calculate the intensity average, gen_hhs_avg.py, which reads in a .csv file with each column containing the dipole expectation value at each laser intensity (this .csv file can be generated from rmt output files using the bin/makedf.py utility). This scripts outputs several different intensity averaged HHS using various different intensity increments and laser beam radii. The bin directory also contains scripts for plotting the figures used in the intensity averaging paper.

The data directory contains the data used in the paper.
